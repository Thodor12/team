## Event Information:
- Minecraft players will join a Modded Minecraft server and have 3 weeks to build a Colony.
- Players will be judged by their skill, biome choice, and how well their colony looks.
- Sabatoge/Griefing is NOT ALLOWED!
- Players will be in SURVIVAL Minecraft for the entire event.

## Objective:
- Build the best-looking colony within 3 weeks using any colony style (I will release multiple guides to the modpack)
- Keep your biome around your village looking fresh and clean
- Make your village as appealing as possible

## Requirements:
- Must make a Town Hall
- Must have 2 Builder's Huts
- Must have a tavern
- Must have a miner
- 2 Guard Towers are REQUIRED

## Other Information:
- MineColonies is a mod based around village building. You need to provide your colony with food and materials to build specific buildings designed to gather food, mine ores and other resources, guard colonists, and so much more!
- The modpack used for our MC server will be a custom modpack I created for this event (BlueCraft MineColonies)
- There will be a cash prize for this event. The amount is TBD (to be determined)
- The IP is 23.139.82.81:25576
- The server will be up PERMANENTLY! The event ends after 3 weeks.
- When you make your colony, you need to place a town hall. Use the command /mc whereami to see the nearest colony to you. You should be around 700 blocks away from the nearest colony.
